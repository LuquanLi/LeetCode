 To understand why it works, first let’s define two events:
Meeting Starts
Meeting Ends

Next, we acknowledge three facts:
The numbers of the intervals give chronological orders
When an ending event occurs, there must be a starting event has happened before that, where “happen before” is defined by the chronological orders given by the intervals
Meetings that started which haven’t ended yet have to be put into different meeting rooms, and the number of rooms needed is the number of such meetings
